                <p class="introductionText">I'm Fabian, a self-taught developer who’s working his way into IT step by
                    step.<br>
                    I enjoy building clean and practical projects - from simple apps to full websites.<br>
                    Coding gives me the mix of creativity and problem-solving I’ve been looking for, <br>
                    and my goal is to grow into a strong all-round developer.<br>
                    When I’m not working on projects, you’ll usually find me gaming or hitting a workout.

                    <p>I’m currently working in retail, but over the last years I discovered how much I enjoy everything
                        related to technology. I started learning programming on my own - first with small C++ console
                        projects, then with Swift and SwiftUI, and later with web development using HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript. Step by step, I built my first own projects, including a Workout Planner app.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What keeps me moving is the feeling of progress. Every new topic I learn, every bug I fix, and
                        every feature I build shows me that switching into IT is the right path for me.
                        My goal is to become a skilled developer who understands how things work under the hood and can
                        create clean, practical solutions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This portfolio is part of that journey.
                        It’s my place to document what I’ve learned and to show the projects I’m working on as I move
                        closer to my career in IT.

                <h3>Workout Planner</h3>
                <p>
                    My Workout Planner is a minimalist iOS app that lets you create custom training sessions in just a
                    few steps. You enter a workout name, add as many exercises as you need, and assign sets and reps for
                    each one. The interface is intentionally clean and distraction-free so you can focus on what
                    matters.
